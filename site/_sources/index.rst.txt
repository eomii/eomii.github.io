The Umii software development infrastructure
============================================

Umii is a collection of development, deployment and monitoring tools that
enables modern, highly automated development workflows.

eomiiOS
    We built ``eomiiOS``, a source-based operating system intended to get the
    maximum performance out of high-spec computers that run demanding workloads
    such as code compilation and deep learning model training.

Build
    Our monolithic skeleton repository is easy to jump into and comes with
    modern toolchains and automation tools that help you write and build better
    code, faster.

Package
    Automatically package your code using lean, secure containerization tools
    that are up to 50 times more efficient than conventional methods.

Deploy
    Modern development workflows require modern deployment workflows. We
    provide a full cloud infrastructure that comes with easy-to-use monitoring
    tools and automated deployment systems.

(Upcoming)
    We are in the process of building a secure lightweight operating system for
    edge devices such as AI inference servers and IoT devices.
